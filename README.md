# Steal this Repo
A repository of free information to help you as a product manager, leader, or decision-maker.  Throughout my career, I've collected and honed a set of information that I find valuable.  Can you find similar information on the internet?  Sure.  But this is the closest you can get to free without sifting through all the ad-ridden SEO garbage that search engines are optimizing around today.
